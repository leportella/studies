All objects have types and they can be scalars or non-scalars.
Scalars (almost indivisible) : integers, floats, booleans, nonetypes.
Non-scalars: strings, 

**Obs:** floats are not the same thing as Real numbers. 
Floats are a computer scientist's approximation to Real numbers, but not quite the same. You can assume it is in most cases.

**Expressions** are sequences of operands (objects) and operators.

**Overloaded operators** have a meaning that depends upon the types of the operands.
