Data analysis procedures can be dichtomized as either exploratory or confirmatory, based on the availability of appropriate models
for the data source, but a key element in both types of procedures (whether for hypothesis formation or decision making) is the 
grouping, or classification of measurements based on either (i) goodness-of-fit to a postulated model or (ii) natural grouping 
(clustering) revelead through analysis (Jain et. al, 1999):.


**Clustering**: is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items or feature vector) 
into groups (clusters). Intuitively, patterns within a valid cluster are more similar to each other than they are
to a pattern belonging to a different cluster (Jain et. al, 1999).

**K-mean technique**: The k-means algorithm takes a dataset X of N points as input, together with a parameter K specifying how 
many clusters to create. The output is a set of K cluster centroids and a labeling of X that assigns each of the points in X to a 
unique cluster. All points within a cluster are closer in distance to their centroid than they are to any other centroid.
